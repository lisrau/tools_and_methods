# tools_and_methods

I will use this repository to keep track of the work done during the tools and methods course, part of the Digital Humanities MA at RUG.
I am interested in art products but I don't yet know which topic I will focus on over the course of these months.

The term Pathosformel coined by Aby Warburg in the early 1900s, refers to certain archetypal images that return in different contexts throughout the centuries of art history. Impett, L. Moretti, F. (2017). Lab Pamphlet 16. Pamphlets of the Stanford Literary Lab. litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet16.pdf already investigates this concept, but I would like to know if there was a way to visualise some aspects of it in a different way. For example, what are all the manifestations of the return of the nymph motif?

If it were a possible way forward, I imagine it would require the use of image databases, ML systems for recognising objects in images, graphs showing the frequency of the pattern over time.

# tools_and_methods

I will use this repository to keep track of the work done during the tools and methods course, part of the Digital Humanities MA at RUG.
I am interested in art products but I don't yet know which topic I will focus on over the course of these months.

If it were a possible way forward, I imagine it would require the use of image databases, ML systems for recognising objects in images, graphs showing the frequency of the pattern over time.

# tools_and_methods
I will use this repository to keep track of the work done during the tools and methods course, part of the Digital Humanities MA at RUG.
I am interested in art products but I don't yet know which topic I will focus on over the course of these months.
Regarding the encounter of Digital Humanities and Art History a reference text is undoubtedly Brown, K. (2022). The Routledge Companion to Digital Humanities and Art History (Routledge Art History and Visual Studies Companions) (1st ed.). Routledge. In which, among other things, one can find many insights from research that has already been undertaken and which deserve further study. 
formulate at least one research question (RQ) and/or hypothesis
explaining how you think you can explore the proposed topic and address the RQs 
describe what kind of data you need to answer your RQs and/or test your hypothesis
